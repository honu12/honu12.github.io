  <!-- Blog A Nameless Ghoul From Ghost Plays ‘Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?-->

  <h2 id="ghost">A Nameless Ghoul From Ghost Plays ‘Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?’</h2>
  <h6>Posted 10/13/15</h6>

  <p>This edition of ‘Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?‘ goes deep into one of modern metal’s biggest phenomenons, Ghost. We managed to track down one of the band’s nameless ghouls to prove and disprove what’s been written about the band.</p>

  <p>Ghost may be the most secretive band on the planet right now. Although they’ve attained massive success, the identities of the musicians within still haven’t been leaked. The nameless ghouls are likely the biggest mystery, so we jumped at the chance
    to peek into the cult’s past and inner workings.</p>

  <p>We asked the ghoul about when Ghost’s flame was first lit. Wikipedia claims that while playing in another band, one of Ghost’s members played the riff to “Satan Prayer,” inspiring the formation of the masked band. Is it true? The ghoul answers in this
    Wiki segment. He also told us how many members actually craft compositions for Ghost and whether or not Papa Emeritus is one of them.</p>

  <p>Wikipedia writes that after a little while, the members of Ghost were forced to tell friends and family about their double lives to keep peace within their respective homes. The masked ghoul explains how that happened and why it was so important.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most fascinating entry on Ghost’s Wikipedia page is the lore that Dave Grohl himself once dressed as a ghoul and performed with Ghost. You’ll get the answer as to whether or not it actually happened right here!

    <!-- Blog James Hetfield: Metallica Are ‘Recording an Album’ Right Now-->

    <h2 id="hetfield">James Hetfield: Metallica Are ‘Recording an Album’ Right Now</h2>
    <h6>Posted 10/12/15</h6>

    <p>While Metallica have been sifting through riffs and reportedly narrowing down the potential songs they want to put on their next album, a couple of James Hetfield comments during a recent video interview on his guitars should generate excitement among
      the band’s fans.</p>

    <p>“I tell ya, we’re recording right now, and there’s the number one guitar, there’s the number two guitar, there’s the number three. And here’s the third-track guitars that just sound different. They all sound different,” reveals Hetfield in the video
      above, confirming later on in the interview (see his quotes below) that the recording is for a new album.</p>

    <p>In the piece, Hetfield praises his history with ESP guitars and EMG pickups and how the companies have helped him realize his music vision. Fans get a closer look at the Truckster guitar that Hetfield reveals comes out of his “car world.” The other
      two instruments featured are his Iron Cross guitar, which looks like it’s been through a few World Wars, and Hetfield’s Snake Bite guitar.</p>

    <p>The rocker concludes, “Unbelievable to be sitting here thinking I designed a guitar, well, I’m not gonna take all the credit obviously, but taking a classic shape, redesigning and thinking of the idea for developing a clean pickup that had dynamics,
      that had power and having it sit here in a guitar and me recording an album after 35 years with it — awesome.</p>

    <h2 id="dimebag">11 Unforgettable Dimebag Darrell Moments</h2>
    <h6>Posted 10/12/15</h6>

    <p>We’ve all seen footage of Dimebag shredding with Pantera in front of tens or even hundreds of thousands of people, but a select few got to see ‘Diamond’ Darrell in his teenage years. Whether filming promos at home or playing like a god at age 18,
      we’ve got Dime’s formative years covered in this Loud List.</p>

    <p>Some of the greatest comedic moments in metal were captured thanks to Pantera’s home videos. Dime was quite a character, which is why confrontations with a Christian group in his hotel room, lighting friends up with fireworks and destroying cars with
      a sledgehammer continue to feel so classic.</p>

    <p>There’s plenty more to see from the unparalleled life of Dimebag Darrell Abbott, so check out 11 Unforgettable Dimebag Darrell Moments in the video.</p>

    <h6>Posted 10/12/15</h6>

    <p>Trivium have just rolled their way to a second straight Cage Match victory. The band’s current single, “Until the World Goes Cold,” held off Bring Me the Horizon’s “Throne” to fight another day and their melodically heavy new song is ready for its
      next challenger.
    </p>

    <p>That comes in the form of Asking Alexandria‘s “I Won’t Give In.” The track, the first to feature new vocalist Denis Stoff, is a blend between melodic heaviness and some haunting vocal work. European fans can listen for the song as the band continues
      touring overseas for the remainder of the year. Dates can be found here.</p>

    <p>So take a listen to both Trivium’s “Until the World Goes Cold” and Asking Alexandria’s “I Won’t Give In” and let us know which track you want to see advance to the next Cage Match. Once you’ve heard the songs, cast your vote in the poll below.</p>
